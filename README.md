# tldr translation progress

Generates and publishes a website, which shows the progress of translation of the 
[tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/) project.

This project is inspired by
* [Extension Registration Wall of Superpowers](https://extreg-wos.toolforge.org/)
* [Python 3 Wall of Superpowers](http://python3wos.appspot.com/)

## Building

This software is build using a [`Taskfile.yml`](Taskfile.yml). 

Install [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/installation) and run
```shell script
task build
```

By default, the css file is minimized (from ~2MB to 6KB), so it just contains the used classes, 
but if you want to tinker on this application, it might be useful to activate the development mode.
In this mode the css file won't be minimized.
```shell script
task build DEV=true
```

If you've already built the project and then activate the development mode it may not work.
Please append the `--force` switch to the task command to force a rebuild.

## Configuration

You can configure certain details using environment variables.

| Environment variable | Description                                  | Required |
| ---                  | ---                                          | ---      |
| GIT_NAME             | The committers name                          | Yes      |
| GIT_EMAIL            | The committers email                         | Yes      |
| SITE_REMOTE_URL      | The Git SSH url of the deployment repository | Yes      |
| CHECK_KNOWN_HOSTS    | Checks the known_hosts file when connecting  | No       |
| DONT_PUBLISH         | No changes will be committed & pushed        | No       |
| MINIFY_HTML          | Minifies the output html file                | No       |
| SSH_KEY_PASSWORD     | A password for the SSH key                   | No       |

You can either let the program generate a new SSH key pair, or you can use your own even if a password is required.
This application doesn't support HTTP authentication.

The program exits after its first run, if you don't use your own key pair.
A new SSH key pair will be generated at the folder `keys`.
Add the public key as a deploy key (with writing access) to the specified repository (`SITE_REMOTE_URL`).

If you specify the environment variable `MINIFY_HTML`, 
the size of the html output file will be reduced by removing spaces and new line characters. 
This is done by the library [tdewolff/minify](https://github.com/).
You can expect the file size to reduce by around 20 % (1.76 MB ðŸ¡’ 1.38 MB).
The css file is minified during the JavaScript build process. 

In the next run the software will generate the status page in the `upstream` folder, commit the changes and push it. 

If you want to test your changes, I recommend you set the environment variable `DONT_PUBLISH` 
and view the updated website locally before deploying it.
The value of this environment variable doesn't matter, it just has be set.

## Scheduled executions using systemd

It's recommended to execute this software daily to keep the website up-to-date.
This repository contains systemd configurations files, which run the program daily at 2am.

If you want to use these files
1. Create a user named `tldr`
2. Put the executable at the path `/home/tldr/progress/update`
3. Copy the files from the [`systemd`](systemd) folder into `/etc/systemd/system/`
4. Finally, run
```shell script
systemctl daemon-reload
# Activating the timer permanently
systemctl enable --now tldr-progress.timer
# Starting the program once to generate the SSH keys
sudo systemctl start tldr-progress.service
```
